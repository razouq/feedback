# todo

- add the base url to the env variables (to use it in email template), replace it by heroku url
- redirection after clicking yes or no to (ejs page) to say 'thank you for voting'
- inside surveyNew (form, review) use a boolean to switch between them, a showFormReview init with false
- in reviewForm component, when we click back, we must have the values in the form
- url for 'yes' and 'no' links to know the user who voted and in the survey, will need path-parser
- might need to use _uniqBy from lodash
